An introduction to the tools of set theory, logic, and induction, and their use in the practice of reasoning about algorithms and programs. As a teaching assistant, I delivered seminar content and marked course assignments and exams.

Topics covered:
- Basic set theory; 
- The notion of a function; 
- Counting; 
- Propositional and predicate logic and their proof systems; 
- Inductive definitions and proofs by induction; 
- Program specification and correctness.
