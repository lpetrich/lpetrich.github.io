This course is an experimental inquisition of the fascinating field of mobile robotics. Students will specifically be exposed to basic concepts, models, and algorithms in autonomous navigation of a mobile robot operating in indoor environments. As a teaching assistant, I developed course material and taught laboratory sessions using The Construct simulation platform. I also created and ran course competitions designed to encourage creative problem solving in the students by combining the covered material into a full robotic system.

Topics covered:
- Robot operating system (ROS); 
- Autonomous navigation; 
- Motion control; 
- Localization; 
- Mapping; 
- Path planning; 
- Object detection;
- Reinforcement learning in robotics.
