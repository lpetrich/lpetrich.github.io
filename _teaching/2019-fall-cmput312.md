As a teaching assistant, I helped develop course material, taught weekly laboratory sessions using the Lego Mindstorm platform, and marked course assignments and exams.    

Topics covered:
- Algorithms and software paradigms for robot programming;
- Mathematical modeling of robot arms and rovers including kinematics, and an introduction to dynamics and control;
- Sensors, motors and their modeling;
- Basics of image processing and machine vision;
- Vision-guided motion control (i.e., visual servoing).
