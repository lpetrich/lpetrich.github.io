This course is an experimental inquisition of the fascinating field of mobile robotics. Students will specifically be exposed to basic concepts, models, and algorithms in autonomous navigation of a mobile robot operating in indoor environments. As the lead teaching assistant, I developed new course material for the Duckiebot platform. I also organized and led four teaching assistants. I taught weekly laboratory sessions and oversaw all marking for the course.

Topics covered:
- Robot operating system (ROS); 
- Autonomous navigation; 
- Motion control; 
- Localization; 
- Mapping; 
- Path planning; 
- Object detection;
- Reinforcement learning in robotics.
