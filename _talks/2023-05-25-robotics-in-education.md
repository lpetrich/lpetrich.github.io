Experimental Mobile Robotics is a wildely popular computing science course at the University of Alberta for both undergraduate and graduate students. In this course, students use a robotic education platform called Duckiebots that travel around a Duckietown. Originating at MIT, Duckietown is a platform for delivering cutting-edge robotics and AI learning experiences. The Duckiebot is a minimal autonomy platform that allows students to investigate complex behaviors, learn about real world challenges, and do research. 

Class instructor, Matt Taylor, alongside Laura Petrich, and class participants will take the the Amii HQ stage to outline the course, dive into challenges and answer questions on experiencial learning in action!

Across the research, business, political and societal spectrum, there are different ideas, excitement, and concerns about the future of AI. Academics and research community members are encouraged to voice their individual point-of-view at Upper Bound without restraint. Amii is committed to providing venues to discuss the future of AI in all its forms.
