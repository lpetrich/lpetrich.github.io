**Abstract**

We consider the problem of visual imitation learning without human kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation, nor access to an interactive reinforcement learning training environment. We present a geometric perspective to this problem where geometric feature correspondences are learned from one training video and used to execute tasks via visual servoing. Specifically, we propose VGS-IL (Visual Geometric Skill Imitation Learning), an end-to-end geometry-parameterized task concept inference method, to infer globally consistent geometric feature association rules from human demonstration video frames. We show that, instead of learning actions from image pixels, learning a geometry-parameterized task concept provides an explainable and invariant representation across demonstrator to imitator under various environmental settings. Moreover, such a task concept representation provides a direct link with geometric vision based controllers (e.g. visual servoing), allowing for efficient mapping of high-level task concepts to low-level robot actions.
