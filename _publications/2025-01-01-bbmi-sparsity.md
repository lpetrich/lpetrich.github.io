**Abstract**

Brain-body-machine interfaces acquire, process, and translate brain signals for individuals with severe motor impairments to communicate and control the assistive technology that supports their daily life activities. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a standard approach for acquiring such brain signals due to its low cost and high temporal resolution. EEG signals can be thought of as a proxy for the user's intent. One established method for translating this intent into inferences and actions are neural networks. However, densely connected neural networks can be computationally expensive---a problem for real-time, deployed brain-body-machine interface systems. In this paper we investigate the use of sparsity in neural networks for EEG-based motor classification, with the goal of reducing the number of neuronal connections without sacrificing a system's performance. We compare two sparsity-inducing algorithms, weight pruning and sparse evolutionary training, with a dense neural network under three experimental conditions. Overall, our results show that sparse neural networks can achieve higher performance accuracy and generalization than their densely-connected counterparts for an EEG-based classification task. We found that sparse evolutionary training achieves the highest and most stable performance across all experiments. Introducing sparsity into the network is a viable option for efficient EEG-based control, with promising applications in a range of related rehabilitation and assistive technologies. This brings us one step closer to helping individuals with severe motor impairments reclaim independence by hopefully allowing for a more intuitive method of interacting with the world around them.
